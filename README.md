# [Storytizer](http://gabe-terrell.github.io/Storytizer/) - User Aided Story Generator

## Background

Storytizer started as a birthday present to a good friend of mine who is an 
avid poet. 

The gist of the project is to allow users to create their own
stories by creating a story template filled with placeholders. The 
placeholders are replaced with a random selection for the placeholder's 
word list to create a unique story with every generation.

The story template, the placeholder names, and the placeholder lists are all
customizable by the user, allowing for maximum creativity. 

As a personal project, this project allowed me to learn more about AJAX and
regex in Javascript (as well as bring hours of entertainment to friends of 
mine). In future iterations of the project, I hope to add buttons to increase
the number of placeholders and to allow placeholder saving to localstorage.
