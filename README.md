# [Storytizer](http://gabe-terrell.github.io/Storytizer/) - User Aided Story Generator

## Getting Started

Storytizer started as a birthday present to a good friend of mine who is an 
avid poet. 

The gist of the project is to allow users to create their own
stories by creating a story template filled with placeholders. The 
placeholders are replaced with a random selection for the placeholder's 
word list to create a unique story with every generation.

The story template, the placeholder names, and the placeholder lists are all
customizable by the user, allowing for maximum creativity. 

As a personal project, this project allowed me to learn more about AJAX and
regex in Javascript. In future iterations of the project, I hope to add buttons
to increase the number of placeholders and to allow placeholder saving to 
localstorage.
